            <h3>Project Manager</h3>
            <h4>Fundusol</h4>
            <p>Leading a team of six researchers, I managed consulting projects for utility-scale photovoltaic installations across seven states. This role taught me the complexity of renewable energy development—from navigating state permitting processes to developing sophisticated financial models that account for everything from agricultural land use to power purchase agreements.</p>
            <p>What I found most rewarding was building computational models that could predict project viability with confidence intervals, helping developers make informed decisions about multi-hundred-million-dollar investments. I also learned the importance of clear communication when coordinating between government officials, developers, and our research team.</p>

            <h3>Project Researcher</h3>
            <h4>SLAC National Laboratory</h4>
            <p>Working on cybersecurity research for energy systems opened my eyes to how vulnerable our electrical grid can be. I focused on the intersection of generative AI and smart home devices, exploring how these technologies could either strengthen or compromise grid security.</p>
            <p>Presenting my findings to the SLAC team was both nerve-wracking and exhilarating—there's something special about contributing to research at a world-class national laboratory while still being an undergraduate.</p>

            <h3>Summer Intern</h3>
            <h4>Schneider Electric Ventures</h4>
            <p>My first real exposure to the venture capital world came through analyzing climate tech markets, particularly how the Inflation Reduction Act was reshaping entire industries. I dove deep into battery storage, direct air capture, and solar recycling—technologies that felt like science fiction just a few years ago.</p>
            <p>Presenting investment recommendations to general partners taught me how to distill complex technical and market analysis into clear, actionable insights. It was intimidating at first, but I learned that thorough research gives you the confidence to stand behind your recommendations.</p>

            <h3>Summer Intern</h3>
            <h4>Stanford Human Trafficking Data Lab</h4>
            <p>This experience shaped how I think about the power of data analysis for social impact. Analyzing satellite imagery to identify potential trafficking sites in the Amazon wasn't just an academic exercise—our work directly supported Federal Police operations.</p>
            <p>Learning to reverse-engineer government databases and optimize data matching algorithms taught me that sometimes the most important technical skills are the ones that help you work with messy, real-world data to create meaningful change.</p>
